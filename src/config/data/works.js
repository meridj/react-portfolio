            It was with this portfolio that I started web development.
            I first developed it in simple Html and JavaScript vanilla. 
            Then I decided to redevelop it with react. Today, I keep it
            updated, and use only the best practices that I learning.
            I polish it like a diamond.

            I love markdown and I was interested to know what was going
            on in the background.. That's why I had fun recreating an
            editor for my personal needs.

            memory is a project I developed during my course at O'clock.io.
            It allows you to work on your memory skills while having fun.
            Several modes of difficulty are proposed including: easy, normal,
            and hard.
